It is annoying to setup a newly installed Ubuntu machine, so I wrote a shell script to install my favorite softwares. You can replace the statements with your favorite commands. ğŸ¥°

The script automatically installs google-chrome, vscode, openssh-server, docker, autojump. If any target command exists, it will skip installing it like this:

$>./setup.sh
